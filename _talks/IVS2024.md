I gave a talk on my published article titled 'Desnowing Algorithm for Long-Wavelength LiDAR ([here is the extended pre-print](/files/Desnowing_Algorithm_for_Long_Wavelength_LiDAR.pdf)) at the [Intelligent Vehicle Symposium 2024](https://ieee-iv.org/2024/), hosted by IEEE ITS.

**Abstract**: Long wavelength light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors have emerged as an essential component for increasing the accuracy and range of perception of autonomous vehicles because they employ directed lasers with wavelengths longer than 1Î¼m. However, adverse weather conditions like fog, rain, and snow pose a major challenge. Longer wavelength lasers generally exhibit increased absorption by water-based ambient particles compared to those with shorter wavelengths. Suspended particles can also significantly scatter the incident laser beam and consequently reduce the sensor accuracy. Filtering out ambient particles is of paramount importance because an accurate representation of the surrounding environment is crucial to ensure safe navigation. Accurately distinguishing between snow particles, snow-covered surfaces, and other objects is challenging due to the varying intensities of the pulsed laser and the spatial orientation of highly reflective surfaces. Despite numerous research works addressing the problem of filtering out snow particles from LiDAR point clouds, there is a significant lack of documented research on long-wavelength LiDAR. Furthermore, many of the filters proposed in the literature are limited in terms of speed and accuracy which impedes their practical implementation in autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a Network-Adjusted Reflectance Filter (NARF), a novel two-phase, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based filtering method for long-wavelength LiDAR that filters out 98.1% of snow particles. We use a custom experimental dataset obtained during a snow event to train and validate the proposed filter. The results shown here illustrate how the developed method outperforms the state-of-the-art geometric filters in terms of both speed and accuracy.
