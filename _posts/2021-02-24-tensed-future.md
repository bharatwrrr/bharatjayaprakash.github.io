Humans are weird. Out of all the species on the planet, we’ve managed to claim the top spot when it comes to obsessing over time—how far back it goes, how far ahead it stretches, and what on earth to do with it in between. 

A lot of this has to do with these little memory cells in our brains. I stub my toe on the coffee table, unleash a stream of curse words, and my brain files it away as a neat little “ouch story.” Later, when I think about it, it’s like opening a mini library of past pain. Really fun.

I recently read that imagining the future works the same way. Those same memory cells store bits of information, and with a little cognitive creativity, the brain pieces them together into vivid mental movies or descriptions of what could happen. It’s like a personal time machine fueled by imagination. The fancy term for this is “prospection,” and it’s not just about serious planning—it can be anything from daydreaming to predicting tomorrow’s weather based on how my joints feel.
